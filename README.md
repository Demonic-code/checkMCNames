# checkMCNames
Make a list of minecraft names you want to know if are available. 
The code checks the list of available names and compiles them in another txt file.

Step 1.
- Make sure you have the requirements install.
- you don't know how to install the requirements?
- Open your folder:
- ![billede](https://github.com/Demonic-code/getName/assets/115573131/3e1716ea-94bc-45b3-95a7-0b9a469343c7)
- write "cmd" and press enter:
- ![billede](https://github.com/Demonic-code/getName/assets/115573131/18bb9594-1e7d-4386-aa3c-de5fc7c195e8)
- use this command in the terminal "pip install -r requirements.txt":
- ![billede](https://github.com/Demonic-code/getName/assets/115573131/15efaaec-16b8-4e91-8ed7-fa62dbc0184f)

Step 2.
- Make a list of names like this:
- ![billede](https://github.com/Demonic-code/getName/assets/115573131/61d6b7ad-9742-476d-ad7e-09801a4275ee)

Step 3.
- Have the list "nameList.txt" and the file "checkMCNames.py" in the same folder.
- Open the file "checkMCNames.py" and let it run.
- Press enter to close then it's done.
